Assignment 1 (Instagram Competitor):

Subj: New Projet, Programming Language

First off, after some consideration, I have decided to go
ahead with the Instagram Competitor.

It is known that the current forms of social media are on a
down-trend. Instagram is has become full of algorithmically
recommended user feeds, Snapchat has become an
buzzfeed-esque feed of meaningless content, and I need not
say more about Twitter (feat. Elon Musk, 2022).

Now is the time to corner that market. There are millions of
users tired of the current nonsense that are the current
social media apps. I still believe, however, that
Instagram's design was the most elegant and has the most
potential. Users are desperate for a less blatant
shareholder pandering and reminisce about the times when the
experience was tailored in a more non-algorithmic fashion.

So, moving forward, we will be attempting to make fit
ourselves into that market using a similar model with which
I am certain we can succeed.

Of course, as for the most important decision. How will we
craft such an application?

In my professional opinion, there are two supporting
languages I had in mind for this project.

The first would be Javascipt. Javascript is THE laguage to
use when building these types of application. It allows the
use of HTML and CSS in dynamic ways, is quick and
non-laborious to get applications up and running, is
compatible with many mobile device OS's, has many
throughouly developed libraries with endless UI elements,
and most importantly, is the programming language backing
many powerful mobile-development frameworks (React-Native,
Ember.js, Angular Mobile, etc.).

With such frameworks, we will have much more control over
development process, can even take advantage of the Node
Package Managaer, and some allow us to deploy to Android and
iOS platforms simultaneously. Also, by utilizing these
framework, we can enforce the best practices that are
described within those frameworks' documentation, keeping
the code clean, simple, and manageable.

Of course, this front-end will not be suitable without a
supporting backend. What is ideal about using Javascipt is
that the backend (and likely supporting API) can be also be
designed utilizing Javascipt. The language has reached a
point where it can handle many of the complex operations
required to develop a thorough backend. There are frameworks
such as (Backbone.js, Meteor.js, Express.js, etc.) that
support creating this part of the application.

Not only that, but since the entire application is being
developed in a single langauge, we can avoid certain project
downfalls such as knowledge monoliths amongst the
developers, as it will be easier to introduce a front-end
developer to the backend of the project and vice-versa. We
overcome a literal language barrier (double entendre
intended), and ensure every dev knows their way around the project.

Now, should the development team come to the consensus that
Javascript is not suitable for the development of this
proposed applicaiton, I support the alternative suggestion
of C# as an alternative.

C#, is the main language used in the .NET Framework, a
popular web-development framework created by Microsoft. It
is widely used and receives full support. Paired with
Xamarin, which is mobile development extension of the .NET
framework would allow us to accomplish very similar goals to
the one set out previously. It is supported on multiple OS
and architectures, with built in support for many best
practices such as dependency injection.

To conclude, I have presented the project idea and my
personal opinions on the languages, technologies, and
frameworks that I believe would fit best. I of couse would
like to hear the consensus of the team before we make the
choice, so please feel free to respond with your opinions.

With regards,
